### Things we need to decide on as a group:

1. What the project is going to be about

   - Connect-4 with an AI trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL).
   - Want to support HvH AIvH & AIvAI

3. What programming language we're gonna use

    - Python, probably a simple command-line interface to start

4. Plan out the initial tasks

    - Crash course in Python!
    - Develop logic for the game, inc HvH mode
      + User interface
      + Logic to determine rules (valid moves, winning conditions, stalemate/end-game, positioning tokens)
      + Design the game "model" (the implementation of the game state)
    - Introduce the ideas behind simple RL, including state-action spaces (Q-tables) & Q-Learning
    - Implement agent using Q-Learning
      + TODO: define steps
